We envision a prosperous\\nand inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and\\ncitizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and\\nScheduled Tribes.\\n2. In the 75th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the\\nIndian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is\\nestimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all\\nthe major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally\\ncaused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right\\ntrack, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.\\n3. Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world\\nappreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders\\nwho had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our\\nendeavors going forward.\\nResilience amidst multiple crises\\n4.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed\\nhungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons\\nfor 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional\\nsecurity, we are implementing, from 1st January 2023, a scheme to supply\\nfree food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one\\nyear, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). The entire\\nexpenditure of about ` 2 lakh crore will be borne by the Central\\nGovernment.\\nG20 Presidency: Steering the global agenda through challenges\\n6. In these times of global challenges, the G20 Presidency gives us a\\nunique opportunity to strengthen India’s role in the world economic order.\\nWith the theme of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, we are steering an\\nambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to\\nfacilitate sustainable economic development.\\nAchievements since 2014: Leaving no one behind\\n7.

Cooperation is a value to be cherished. In realizing our Prime\\nMinister’s goal of “Sahkar se Samriddhi”, and his resolve to “connect the\\nspirit of cooperation with the spirit of Amrit Kaal”, in addition to the\\nmeasures proposed in Part A, I have a slew of proposals for the co-operative\\nsector.'),\n",

I\\nhave five major announcements to make in this regard. These primarily\\nbenefit our hard-working middle class.\\n146. The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to\\n` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I\\npropose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus,\\npersons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to\\npay any tax.\\n147. The second proposal relates to middle-class individuals.\\nI had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime\\nwith six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax\\nstructure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and\\nincreasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are:\\n` 0-3 lakh Nil\\n` 3-6 lakh 5 per cent\\n` 6-9 lakh 10 per cent\\n` 9-12 lakh 15 per cent\\n` 12-15 lakh 20 per cent\\nAbove ` 15 lakh 30 per cent\\n148. This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An\\nindividual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only\\n` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25\\nper cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-. Similarly,\\nan individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only\\n` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent\\nfrom the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.\\n149.

Each salaried person with an\\nincome of ` 15.5 lakh or more will thus stand to benefit by ` 52,500.\\n150. My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the\\nhighest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the\\nhighest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37\\nper cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction\\nof the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent.\\n151. Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment\\non retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the\\nyear 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/-\\npm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to\\nincrease this limit to ` 25 lakh.\\n152. We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax\\nregime. However, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the\\nbenefit of the old tax regime.\\n153. Apart from these, I am also making some other changes as given in\\nthe annexure.\\n154.
